            <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Heat ghee in a non-stick pan over medium heat.</li>
              <li>Add condensed milk and water to the pan. Stir well to combine.</li>
              <li>Add the milk powder gradually while stirring continuously to avoid lumps</li>
              <li>Keep stirring the mixture over medium-low heat until it thickens and starts leaving the sides of the
                pan. This may take around 8-10 minutes.</li>
              <li>Add cardamom powder and mix well.</li>

            <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Prepare the Pan: Grease a square or rectangular pan with a little ghee. This will prevent the barfi
                from sticking to the pan.</li>
              <li>Mix Ingredients: In a heavy-bottomed pan, combine the condensed milk, milk powder, sugar, and ghee.
              </li>
              <li>Cook the Mixture: Cook the mixture over medium-low heat, stirring continuously to prevent it from
                sticking to the bottom of the pan. Keep stirring until the mixture thickens and starts leaving the sides
                of the pan. This process usually takes around 10-15 minutes.</li>
              <li>Add Flavoring (Optional): If you're using cardamom powder for flavor, add it to the mixture once it
                thickens. Stir well to combine.</li>
              <li>Transfer to the Pan: Once the mixture thickens and starts leaving the sides of the pan, immediately
                pour it into the greased pan.</li>
